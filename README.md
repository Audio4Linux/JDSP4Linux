# JamesDSPManager (Audio Effect Digital Signal Proccessing library for Android)
Merged with Omnirom DSP Manager features and able to run in all recent Android rom include Samsung, AOSP, Cyanogenmod. 
This app in order to improve your music experience especially you want realistic bass and more natural clarity.
We don't work too much around with modifying Android framework instead of we integrate framework with DSP Manager, let it less depend on system framework.

##### Basic:

1. Compression
2. Bass Boost
3. Virtualizer
4. 12 Band Hybrid Equalizer (1 low shelf, 10 bands shelves, ,1 high shelves)(Different bands designed with different filter order)
5. Stereo Widen
6. Adjustable Low pass filter(Bass Boost)
7. 3 custom bass boost mode

##### On development:

1. Linear phase FIR Equalizer

	-->Status: [EffectVirtualizerBK.cpp](https://github.com/james34602/JamesDSPManager/blob/master/Audio_Engine/eclipse_libjamesdsp_many_bands_Marshmallow_reverb/jni/EffectVirtualizerBK.cpp) is a working integer FFT filter based on Ne10 FFT library
2. Parameterized Room Convolution

	-->May be I  will implement this in my other repository: [Complete C implementation of Room Impulse Response Generator](https://github.com/james34602/RIR-Generator)

Now work on AOSP, Cyanogenmod, Samsung on Android 5.0 ,6.0 and 7.0(TESTED)

1. See my project release page

# Development
The folder end with reverb is my new developing project, but they have no functionality, it can response user via Logcat

# Important

### More Credit
DSPFilter.xlsx is a tool for you to desgin IIR Biquad Filter, it is a component from miniDSP.

RBJ_Eq.xls is a RBJ Biquad Equalizer designer. For me, not very useful and I will not implement it, but could be a reference to designing equalizer.
